# kubahorak's Keychron Q1 keymap for ISO Encoder

This ISO Encoder layout got heavily inspired by gtg465x's ANSI keymap (rev_0100).

Features:
- The rightest key column is: Mute, Home, PgUp, PgDn, which differs from the default.
- Rotary knob changes volume, with Fn it changes RGB brightness
- Fn+Delete mapped to Shift+Insert
- RGB lighting turns off when the computer sleeps
- Caps Lock and alpha keys turn red to indicate when Caps Lock is on
- When the Fn layer is active, RGB lighting turns off for keys that are not assigned

## Changelog
